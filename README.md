## Contributing

Commit messages must comply with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). Otherwise [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) will complain. :)

Thanks to [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen), `npm run commit` command can be used to create commit messages complying with conventional commits.
